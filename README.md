## Who I am?

* Born in São Paulo
* I Live in Guarulhos, SP
* Married to Amanda Gonçalves e very happy
* Graduated in Computer Science at Universidade Guarulhos in 2009 and studying MBA in Information Technology Management at FIAP.
* About 13 years of experience in software development (C# as the man language). Much of that experience was as a software engineer at the following companies:
  - Talktelecom (currently IPCorp 91)
  - Economic value
  - SHC Group (JAC Motos and Citroen)
  - Saraiva Bookstore
  - Serasa Experian
* In 2013 I received an invitation to start entrepreneurship in the means of payment area, this is where I had my first participation in a technology company focused on means of payment. 
However, this company went bankrupt. Then came my second invitation to undertake, only this time not as a technology supplier for the market, but as a player in the market. 
It was where we created BestPay that I was the director for 2 years and 5 months. My responsibility was in the area of technology and operations.
* In 2017, my partner Fernando Castro and I decided to sell our stake in BestPay and open a sub-acquirer where we were the majority shareholders, 
that's where we created JoyPay together with Daniel Nery's participation as our partner. As the CTO my responsibility was the technology, operations and finance areas.
* In June 2019, I received an invitation from my friend Guilherme Cavalcante, CEO of Ucorp, to help him with the technology of his startup. 
They had a great deal to do, with a short term for a giant client, Itaú, and they didn't have a technology area, much less a system. 
I worked as an architect and system developer, created a team, hired a manager and passed the responsibilities on to him. Today I no longer work, I am only part of the board as a Tech Advisor and I have participation of the company in recognition of my delivery.
* In November 2019, we sold JoyPay to Ebanx. And with this acquisition, I was gaining the mission to help Ebanx enter the competition in the world of credit card machines, 
being responsible for the Ebanx Pay technology team.
